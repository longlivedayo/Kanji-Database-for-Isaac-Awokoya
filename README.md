In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for various applications in the field of natural language processing and character recognition.
This paper presents an in-depth exploration of the application of machine learning techniques for Japanese Kanji detection. Kanji which is
an integral part of the Japanese writing system, poses unique challenges due to its complexity and the vast number of characters involved.
The ability to accurately detect and classify Kanji characters has significant implications for a wide range of applications,
including optical character recognition (OCR), language processing, Image-text detection and conversion and information retrieval.
This study investigates the effectiveness of the machine learningalgorithm, Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)with conjoining help from
previous work which included neural machine translation (NMT), recurrent
neural networks (RNNs), and support vector machines (SVMs), in the task of
Kanji detection. 

Various pre-processing techniques such as loading, grayscale
conversion, thresholding, contour detection, bounding boxes, and extraction
of characters were utilised to enhance the modelâ€™s performance. 

Additionally,a dataset comprising a diverse set of extracted handwritten Kanji characters
was used for training and validation. 
The primary research aim and objective is to explore the potential of machine learning, deep learning, and artificial
intelligence in facilitating the detection of Japanese Kanji characters.
Furthermore, we delve into the challenges of handling class imbalance issues, where some Kanji characters are significantly more common than others, and
propose strategies to mitigate this problem. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of machine learning in accurately detecting Japanese Kanji
characters, achieving high precision and recall rates. The findings have practical implications for improving the accuracy and efficiency of OCR systems 
for Japanese text and contribute to the broader field of character recognition.
In conclusion, this paper provides valuable insights into the application of machine learning for Japanese Kanji detection. The research contributes to 
the growing body of knowledge in character recognition and paves the way for enhanced Kanji-related applications in the realms of language processing,
document analysis, and information retrieval.
